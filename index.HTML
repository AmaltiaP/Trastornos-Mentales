            <h2 id="depresion"> Depression </h2>
            <p> 
                Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. 
                Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to 
                a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.
            </p>

            <h2 id="narcisista">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
            <p>
                It's not known what causes narcissistic personality disorder. The cause is likely complex. 
                Narcissistic personality disorder may be linked to: 
                Environment — parent-child relationships with either too much adoration or too much criticism that don't match the child's actual experiences
                 and achievements.
                 Genetics — inherited characteristics, such as certain personality traits.
                 Neurobiology — the connection between the brain and behavior and thinking.
                Maladaptive narcissism, on the other hand, is characterized by the toxic traits, such as a sense of entitlement and willingness to exploit others. 
                The different forms of maladaptive narcissism include:
                <h4>Overt or grandiose narcissism.</h4> 
                Overt narcissists tend to be extroverted but also uncooperative, selfish, and overbearing. Their exaggerated self-image 
                and high self-esteem allow them to be confident and assertive. However, they’re also likely to overestimate their own emotional intelligence.
                <h4>Covert or vulnerable narcissism.</h4>
                It's common to imagine all narcissists as dominant and overwhelming in social situations.
                However, covert narcissists are introverted. They tend to be extremely sensitive to criticism and suffer from low self-esteem. They can be defensive 
                and passive-aggressive, but they are less likely to overestimate their emotional abilities than overt narcissists.
               <h4>Communal narcissism.</h4>  
                Communal narcissists tend to view themselves as altruistic and claim to care deeply about fairness. They presentthemselves to others as supportive and 
                selfless. However, their behavior is motivated by a desire for social power and a sense of superiority or entitlement. Because of this, their actions
                 don’t always match their beliefs.
                <h4>Antagonistic narcissism. </h4>
                In contrast with communal narcissists, antagonistic narcissists take a highly competitive approach to social interactions. 
                They often exhibit zero-sum thinking, believing that every situation has a “loser” and “winner.” This view of the world leads them to be aggressive 
                and hostile. They may be quick to disparage others and slow or unwilling to forgive.
                <h4>Malignant narcissism.</h4>     
                Malignant narcissism can be a more destructive form of the personality disorder. In addition to the typical signs of narcissism, 
                a malignant narcissist might be aggressive, paranoid, or sadistic—taking joy in other people’s pain. They tend to display antisocial behavior, 
                disregarding the rights or safety of others.

            <h2 i="esquizofrenia">Schizophrenia</h2>
            <p>
                Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost
                touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate
                in usual, everyday activities, but effective treatments are available. Many people who receive treatment can engage in school or work, achieve independence,
                and enjoy personal relationships.
